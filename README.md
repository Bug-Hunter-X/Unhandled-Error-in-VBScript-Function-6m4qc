This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript: insufficient error handling within functions. The `bug.vbs` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a more robust solution.  VBScript's `Err` object is crucial for managing runtime errors, but improper use can lead to unexpected application behavior or crashes.  The solution emphasizes comprehensive error handling, logging, and graceful error recovery.
